Task 1.2
$ ip addr show
Shows all the interfaces of the server.
show / manipulate routing, devices, policy routing and tunnels
Results of running the command on the server can be interpreted as following:
1 - loopback interface for localhost
2 - eth0 interface for ethernet
3,4 - eth1 and eth1 interfaces

$ nslookup blue orange

Instead of using default DNS server’s for querying, we can also specify a particular name server to resolve the domain name.
In the above command, we have used the orange as the DNS server.

$ tracepath blue
tracepath traces the network path to a specified destination and reports each “hop” along the path. In our case the cammand outputs all the hops our request takes to reach domain name 'blue'. That is one hop to 10.0.0.12.

$ netstat -taop
Displays all the active and waiting TCP connections. Along with information related to networking timers, the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.
For example, own ssh connection can be seen -
tcp        0      0 10.1.1.2:ssh            10.1.1.1:54102          ESTABLISHED -                keepalive (6097.52/0/0)

wget command is used to download a file from the Internet without leaving the terminal.
$ wget -q -O blue
The command above Turns off Wget’s output and documents (web page) downloaded from server 'blue' will be printed to standard output, disabling link conversion.

for i in $(seq 1 254); do ip=10.0.0.$i; if ping -q -c 1 $ip 2>&1>/dev/null; then echo -e "$ip up"; fi; done
The statement pings (without output and with only one packet) addresses from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.254
Moves the standard error '2' to standard output '1' which is than discarded (/dev/null).
If the ping is successful it echos the message that the respective ip "is up".
Got addresses:
10.0.0.1 up
10.0.0.10 up
10.0.0.12 up

Task 1.3
Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

For example, scanning for localhost:
~$ nmap localhost

Starting Nmap 7.12 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-04-27 22:09 CEST
Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
Host is up (0.000063s latency).
Other addresses for localhost (not scanned): ::1
Not shown: 996 closed ports
PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
111/tcp open  rpcbind
139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp open  microsoft-ds

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.05 seconds
