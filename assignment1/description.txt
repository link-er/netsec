adilova@hellgate:~$ nslookup blue orange
Server:   orange
Address:  10.0.0.10#53

Name: blue
Address: 10.0.0.12

query Internet name servers interactively
DESCRIPTION
       Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers.  Nslookup has two modes: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive mode allows the user to query name
       servers for information about various hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain. Non-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested
       information for a host or domain.

ARGUMENTS
       Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:

       1.  when no arguments are given (the default name server will be used)

       2.  when the first argument is a hyphen (-) and the second argument is the host name or Internet address of a name server.

traces path to a network host discovering MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) along this path
It  traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path.  It uses UDP port port or some random port.  It is similar to traceroute, only does not require superuser
       privileges and has no fancy options.

The non-interactive network downloader.
GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.

       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background, while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a retrieval and disconnect from the
       system, letting Wget finish the work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of
       data.

       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory structure of the original site.  This
       is sometimes referred to as "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert the
       links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for offline viewing.

       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will keep retrying until the whole file
       has been retrieved.  If the server supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the download from where it left off.
